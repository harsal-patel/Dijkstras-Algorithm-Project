| C++ file contains all the code needed to run the program. Certain commands are
| accessible on Windows OS only. The commands for this have comments next to them
| explaining this for the user's convenience. The maps are stored in text files and
| are used in the program.

Features:

| Fully playable game that gives a visual example of Dijkstra's algorithm to find
| the shortest path between two objects. All information needed to play the game can
| be found in the running program from the main menu. An example map with its
| corresponding adjacency list is also viewable from the main menu.
